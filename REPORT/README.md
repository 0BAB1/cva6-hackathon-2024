# A word on the report article

I made 3 designs, this repo only contains the fastest but the reporting article talks about all 3 of them because I though it was a good thing to make comparisons ansd to show some example of what we can do on CVA6 and CV-X-IF.
NB : the video will not talkk about the first two designs and will only focus an the last one (ie the one in this repo)

# this folder contains : 

- 6-page (more like 8...) report written as a scientific paper
- Simulation log (uart)
- P&R report with the maximum frequency (corev_apu/fpga/report_cva6_fpga_impl/cva6_fpga.timing.rpt)
- Report of resources (corev_apu/fpga/report_cva6_fpga_impl/cva6_fpga.utilization.rpt)
- Log of the execution on the FPGA board (copy or screenshot of the hyperterminal output)
- Synth reports
